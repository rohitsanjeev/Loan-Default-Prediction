# Loan-Default-Prediction
Task: Predict whether a loan applicant will default on their loan or not
Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, clean data inconsistencies, encode categorical features (e.g., loan purpose, credit history), scale numerical features (e.g., income, loan amount).
Feature Engineering (Optional): Create features like debt-to-income ratio, loan term to income ratio, credit score bands, etc.
Train Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM). Explore different models and compare their performance.
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC. In loan default, consider the cost of false positives (denying a good loan) vs. false negatives (approving a bad loan).
Deployment (Basic API): Build a basic API to predict loan default risk for new loan applications.
